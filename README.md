This program takes a .asm file as an input and outputs the MIPS instructions within this .asm file in binary and hex (machine code). The way we do this is first, we ignore all lines in the .asm file until we reach the .text directive. After that, we are going line by line and splitting it up to have all components separate (instruction, value, register, etc.). Then we first find the correct instruction in binary by having an already-made array of instructions with the same index as another array that has the corresponding binary value of that instruction. I have split up the arrays by whether it’s an R type or I type instruction, and whether it’s a logical instruction, arithmetic instruction, branch instruction, etc. This way we know exactly how we have to construct the final 32-bit word after finding the correct instruction. Then, if we have addresses in the line, I have a function that converts the address to the correct binary value, with 5 bits. Then if we have a constant value, I have a function that converts that to binary, while making sure its 16 bits. We find all of these different pieces in the current line we are looking at and then based off of what type it is and what type of instruction it is, I correctly concatenate all the different binary values we found so it’s correct machine code. I print out that value and then lastly print out the hexadecimal equivalent to it.

TL;DR: This program is a MIPS assembler that takes care of most instructions.
